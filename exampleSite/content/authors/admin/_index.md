I ~~am~~ was a PhD student in the [GAIA](http://www.gipsa-lab.fr/cics.php) team of GIPSA Lab under the supervision of [Nicolas Tremblay](http://www.gipsa-lab.fr/~nicolas.tremblay/), [Simon Barthelmé](https://barthesi.gricad-pages.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) and [Pierre-Olivier Amblard](https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/~bidou.amblard/).
In my thesis, I am working on [Monte Carlo algorithms for linear algebra](https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.5557) based on a particular stochastic process on graphs, called [random spanning forests](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1723).

**Breaking News!** I defended my thesis on 15 November 2022. [See here](publication/phdthesis/) for more details.
